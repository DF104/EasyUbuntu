Quick Installation Scripts For installing some functions such as LNMP or something(e.g like tunnels) for self used  , or BBR in KVM VPS .

How To Use :
 - download script file
 - run as root
 - done.
 
Generally speaking most of scripts listed here are suggested running with Ubuntu version >= 14.04 , some script(such as lnmp) running in higher version should edit the source first for correctly installation.

Attention : 
 - Please use root privileges (either su or sudo ) to run all the scripts as most of them installing packages via "apt"
 - Some of script may suggested to run only in your testing or development environment (such as nginx-tls1.3-draft18) as there is something unstable here for production.
